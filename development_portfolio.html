  <h1> Personal Biography: Preston Begbie </h1>
  <h2> Development Portfolio </h2>
  <p>
    There have been a few assignments in CINS 110 that have really expanded my
    knowledge of HTML coding and building websites. Below will be some examples
    of my work and though some I would change to make better, it goes to show
    that I am still learning and improving.
  </p>
  <div>
    <a href="https://github.com/prestonbegbie18">
      My GetHub account page.
    </a>
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://github.com/prestonbegbie18/ChicoInShort">
      This was one of the first assignments we did and put on to GetHub. We always
      remember the first. "Chico In Short"
    </a>
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://github.com/prestonbegbie18/ProfessorPage">
      This assignment was our taste into CSS. This assignment showed me that styling
      pages didn't have to be done in the HTML files themselves. "Professor Page"
    </a>
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://github.com/prestonbegbie18/MovieSpoiler">
      This was one of my favorite assignments because of what we actually did. We
      got to discuss our favorite movie, in detail, and protected the viewer of our
      information from spoilers. This assignment is truly my favorite so far because
      of my love of movies. "Movie Spoilers"
    </a>
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://github.com/prestonbegbie18/BuildingTabs">
      The Building tabs assignment was a major gateway to this page. It was our
      first assignment dealing with multiple pages and linking them together.
      "Building Tabs"
    </a>
  </div>
  <div>
    <a href="https://github.com/prestonbegbie18/MySchedule">
    This was our first taste into tables in HTML and CSS with tables. This helped
    give me a better understanding of design and why the links for this page are
    in a table format. "My Schedule"
    </a>
  </div>
  <nav>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td class="nav-tab">
          <a href="index.html" class="navigation">Home</a>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nav-tab">
        <a href="interests.html" class="navigation">Interests</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nav-tab">
        <a href="computing_bio.html" class="navigation">Computing Biography</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nav-tab">
        <a href="development_portfolio.html" class="navigation">Development Portfolio</a>
      </td>
    </tr>
