  <h1> Personal Biography: Preston Begbie </h1>
  <h2> Interests </h2>
  <p>
    Here is the page where you will learn about my interests. I am mainly a gamer
    and student. I have been a gamer for most of my life. Ever since I could
    lift a controller. My favorite games include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Batman: Arkham Franchise</li>
    <li>Dishonored</li>
    <li>Dishonored 2</li>
    <li>Final Fantasy VII</li>
    <li>Final Fantasy XV</li>
    <li>Star Wars Games</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I am also a huge movie guy. I love the Star Wars films, superhero films, and
    a few other titles. This has been who I am for over twenty years. I hope to
    finish college in 2020 or a little later (I'm in no rush) and pursue my dreams
    of working in the entertainment business, comics, games, or any computer job.
    This is my life. This is who I am and I am proud to be who I am.
