  <h2> Computing Biography </h2>
  <p>
    In my Interests page, I mentioned that I am a gamer, which also means that I
    love technology. I take good care of my tech and learn to use it properly. I
    have experience in C++ programming though I am no expert. I have written many
    reports and tables using computer programs and basic programs. I even recently
    made business cards for my mother's business. I am also preficient in Photoshop,
    even though I don't use those skills anymore. Technology and computers have been
    a big part of my life and I'm sure they will for years to come.
